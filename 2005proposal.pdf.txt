Appendix B BRAC 2005 Closure and Realignment Impacts by Economic Area
Note
The listing of installations in this appendix does not include BRAC actions for where there are no (zero) net job changes. In a limited number of cases, the impact of National Guard or Reserve facility job changes were aggregated with those of the closest active military installation, or of a nearby National Guard or Reserve facility.
Definitions
Economic Area is the economic region of influence assigned to each installation for BRAC 2005. Details on the assignment of installations to economic areas can be found in the description of the activities of Joint Process Action Team 6.
Installation is the common name of the installation. In a limited number of cases, the impact of National Guard or Reserve facility job changes were aggregated with those of the closest active military installation, or of a nearby guard or reserve facility.
Action is the BRAC 2005 action for the installation, such as close, realign, or gain.
Out Mil is the number of military personnel authorizations that are either eliminated or re-located from the installation to a new location outside of their current economic area. Relocations within the same economic area do not constitute a BRAC economic impact.
Out Civ is the number of civilian personnel authorizations that are either eliminated or re-located from the installation to a new location outside of their current economic area. Relocations within the same economic area do not constitute a BRAC economic impact.
In Mil is the number of military personnel authorizations relocating into the installation from another economic area.
In Civ is the number of civilian personnel authorizations relocating into the installation from another economic area.
Net Gain/(Loss) Mil is the net change in the number of military personnel authorizations by installation.
B - i
________________
Net Gain/(Loss) Civ is the net change in the number of civilian personnel authorizations by installation.
Net Mission Contractors is the change in the number non-government employees who perform one or more of the military missions on the installation, and whose work tasks are virtually identical to government civilian employees or military personnel, expressed in full time equivalents.
Indirect Changes is the sum of estimated indirect and induced job changes in the community associated with the change in Total Direct Jobs. Indirect job changes are the net addition or loss of local non-government jobs supporting installation material, service, and infrastructure needs, such as a local motor pool parts distributors or base operations support (BOS) contractors. Induced job changes are the net addition or loss of local non-government jobs in industries that provide goods or services to the households of direct or indirect installation employees. Examples include local grocery stores, retail stores, and restaurants.
Total Job Changes is the sum of the Total Direct and Indirect Changes entries.
Economic Area Employment is employment in the economic area for calendar year 2002, which was the most recent official employment data available from the Department of Commerce’s Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) at the time of the development of the BRAC 2005 Economic Impact Tool.
Changes as a Percent of Employment is the result of dividing Total Job Changes by Economic Area Employment.
